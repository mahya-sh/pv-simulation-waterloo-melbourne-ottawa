This repository contains the design and simulation of three grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) systems using PVsyst. It includes:
**a 2.5MW ground-mounted utility-scale PV plant in Waterloo, Canada**
**a 10MW utility-scale PV plant in Melbourne, Australia**
**a 1MW rooftop PV system on an industrial building in Centretown, Ottawa**
The project covers string sizing, inverter selection, shading analysis, and energy yield simulations.
